# Issues with data

-   Duplication of Sizes in different formats (S, SMALL, s)
-   Descriptions of products submitted as sizes (Yellow)
-   Products Information included with sizes (S / One left! Or S / Yellow)
-   Very little rows have filters
-   Rows cannot fall into many categories
-   Different standards of sizes (i.e 100cm vs 8 Months VS EU VS UK VS ITA) and no clear way to define buckets

  

# Priority List

1.  Try to assign filters to as many rows as possible with as little intervention as possible 
2.  Try to bucket sizes where possible and create rules to push them into buckets
3.  Clean up different filter labels
4.  Create a plan to decide on supported buckets
5.  Clean up labels
