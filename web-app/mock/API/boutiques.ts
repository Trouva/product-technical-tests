We are located at fashion landmark 21 Queen’s Road which was home to Brighton Biba in the 1960s.\\n\\nAt FAIR we stock a range of different brands whose ethical credentials are second to none, not only in their support for Fair Trade production but increasingly through the use of organic and sustainable fabrics. We have a fabulous range of womenswear and childrenswear and a developing selection of menswear as well as products for your home.\\n\\nSo why Fair Trade? For us at FAIR, it’s a completely different way of doing business that ensures people and the planet get the respect that they deserve. Awareness of the social and environmental costs of “fast fashion” has grown tremendously in the last few years and consumers are increasingly seeking out alternatives. We are here to offer those alternatives and show consumers that there is another way.\\n\\nSince 2008, FAIR has been nominated for a number of local and national ethical fashion awards. Most recently, FAIR has been nominated in the category of Best Independent Boutique for the Ethical Fashion Forum’s 2012 Source Awards.  This award recognizes best practice in the curation, marketing and sale of sustainable fashion through a multi brand platform.",

      "With a background in marketing and communications, founder James Borely started his retail career with a bespoke lighting brand in 2013. Through designing and buying ranges of lamps, James discovered a world of makers, designers and small brands that he felt were unrepresented in his local area. Starting out as a pop-up shop in Brixton, Resident Store flourished online until James found the perfect space in Frome, Somerset. Now based in a Grade II listed building, Resident Store is a curated collection of unusual homewares and lifestyle products from known brands to up and coming designers. ",
